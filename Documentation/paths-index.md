# Filename Manipulation Package #

This package provides portable functions and variables to manipulate the file system :
 
  * [Manipulating filenames](paths-filenames.md) : functions for manipulating filenames ;
  * [Directory functions](paths-dirfunctions.md) : functions for listing and manipulating directories ;
  * [Directory paths](paths-dirpaths.md) : paths to well known directories ;
  * [Miscellaneous](paths-misc.md) : uncategorized functions ;

When this package is loaded, it also computes a number of useful 
variables indicating where the various Torch components are installed.  
Do not change their values.
